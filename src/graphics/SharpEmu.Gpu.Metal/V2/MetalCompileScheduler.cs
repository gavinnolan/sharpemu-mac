/// Orders the driver's compiler service between the game and the background prewarm. Every
/// front-end or back-end call reaches one MTLCompilerService, which runs them side by side,
/// so a runtime miss the GPU worker waits for competed with up to twelve prewarm compiles
/// (the compute and graphics prewarm's six threads and the library list's six) and took
/// seconds instead of a fraction of one. Demon's Souls' boot spent 80 s of a 99 s window
/// waiting for 34 such libraries (run 20261018-203322-ds-ds-memopt-check, game.log:1037).
///
/// A runtime compile counts from the moment the game asks for it (a module queued on
/// MetalLibraryCompilePool, a pipeline state made on the worker) until it is done. A
/// prewarm compile enters through <see cref="EnterPrewarm"/>, which lets it start only
/// while no runtime compile is pending and none finished within the quiet period (the
/// worker's misses come in bursts, and the gap between two of them used to be enough for
/// six prewarm compiles to start), and never more than the prewarm's own share at once. A
/// prewarm compile already in the driver runs on: a runtime miss for the same source
/// waits for it rather than starting a second one (MetalShaderPrewarm.WaitWhileCompiling,
/// MetalLibraryPrewarm.TryTake).
///
/// So that the prewarm is not starved forever while the game compiles continuously, a
/// prewarm thread that has waited for <see cref="StarvationLimit"/> may start one compile
/// whenever no other prewarm compile is in the driver: a trickle of one.

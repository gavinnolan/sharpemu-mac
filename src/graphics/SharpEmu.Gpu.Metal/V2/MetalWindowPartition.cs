/// <para>
/// Disjoint because Metal does not keep two buffers over the same pages coherent inside a
/// command buffer. Measured on an M4 (MetalGuestWindowGranuleTests): a blit or a kernel that
/// writes bytes through one no-copy buffer and a later blit or kernel in the same command
/// buffer that reads them through another buffer over the same pages reads the old bytes -
/// with a fence between them, with a buffer-scope memory barrier between them in one
/// encoder, and in every blit/compute combination - while the same read through the same
/// buffer, or through the other buffer from the next command buffer, sees the write. The GPU
/// caches by virtual address, and a buffer is a virtual address range. So a guest byte has to
/// have one GPU address for the life of a command buffer, which overlapping windows (a seam
/// shared by two windows, or a span window over granules that also have their own windows)
/// cannot give.

/// A range that crosses a cut moves the cut rather than merging the windows it touches.
/// Merging whole windows chains: in a heap packed with allocations, one straddles each
/// granule edge, and every two of them share the granule between their edges, so merging
/// would grow one window across the whole heap. Moving the cut to the end of the range
/// (rightwards; leftwards to its start, or around it on both sides, when that would make
/// the window larger than the cap) changes only the two windows beside it, and only ranges
/// that really overlap each other end up in one window.
/// </para>

/// <para>
/// A move replaces the windows it changes with new buffers at new GPU addresses, so it may

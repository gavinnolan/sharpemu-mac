// Sampled textures held from their T# BASE_LEVEL.
//
// On the PS5 the texture unit never reads a level finer than BASE_LEVEL (the SDK's
// Texture::setMipLevelRange "redefines the size of the base map to that at baseMipLevel";
// LAST_LEVEL bounds the other end), and a title's texture streamer uses exactly that: Demon's
// Souls keeps only some levels of each streamed texture resident, decommits the guest memory
// of the finer ones, and writes BASE_LEVEL = the resident top level into the T#. A texture
// allocated with the whole chain spends three quarters of its bytes or more on levels the GPU
// cannot sample, and its upload reads guest pages the title has released.
//
// So a sampled-only image gets a texture of the guest levels from BASE_LEVEL down (to the
// chain's last level, which keeps a different LAST_LEVEL from changing the texture over
// levels a quarter the size of the one above them). The image's description stays the full
// guest chain: identity, the page index and every guest offset are the guest's, and only
// the texture, the bytes uploaded into it and the page watch are cut to those levels.
// Shaders are unchanged: they sample through a view whose level 0 is BASE_LEVEL either way
// (MetalCachedImage.GetOrCreateView).
//
// The texture follows the binding:
//  - a binding that needs a finer level gets a texture with it at once, filled from guest
//    memory (the streamer only lowers BASE_LEVEL after the level is resident);
//  - a binding that needs only coarser levels keeps the texture through a view until no
//    binding for a whole window of presented frames (ShrinkWindowFrames) needed the finer
//    ones, and then shrinks it to the finest level any binding in that window needed -
//    not to the level of the binding that happens to look - because every level dropped
//    gives back about three quarters of what is left and the coarser levels that are
//    uploaded again are only a third of the level above them. The window is per image and
//    per level: two descriptors of one texture with different BASE_LEVELs keep it at the
//    finer one, and a texture that had to grow back soon after a shrink doubles its window
//    (up to 2^MaxShrinkBackoff), so a descriptor that comes back every so often cannot make
//    it trade reallocations. Frames, not seconds or submissions, because a title presenting
//    twice a second still binds its textures once per frame. A texture whose finer levels
//    hold less than ShrinkMinimumBytes is not worth the reallocation;
//  - anything that writes the image (render target, storage, clear, copy, kernel fill)
//    gets the whole chain first (PromoteLinearView), so a cut texture is never written
//    back and write-back and retiling of GPU-written images are as they were.
//
// Only a binding tells the cache a texture's BASE_LEVEL (the T# lives in guest memory), so a
// texture the title coarsens and stops binding keeps its levels until age retirement or the
// budget takes the whole image.
//
// SHARPEMU_METAL_V2_BASE_LEVEL=0 allocates every texture with its whole chain again.
